Medicare Provider Charge
========================

Last update by Benjamin Chan (<benjamin.ks.chan@gmail.com>) on `2013-05-26 21:27:19` using `R version 2.15.3 (2013-03-01)`.

Analyze CMS Medicare Provider Charge public use dataset. The data is documented and can be downloaded at the Medicare Provider Charge Data [website](http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/index.html).

> As part of the Obama administrationâ€™s work to make our health care system more affordable and accountable, data are being released that show significant variation across the country and within communities in what hospitals charge for common inpatient services.

> The data provided here include hospital-specific charges for the more than 3,000 U.S. hospitals that receive Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) payments for the top 100 most frequently billed discharges, paid under Medicare based on a rate per discharge using the Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2011. These DRGs represent almost 7 million discharges or 60 percent of total Medicare IPPS discharges.

> Hospitals determine what they will charge for items and services provided to patients and these charges are the amount the hospital bills for an item or service. The Total Payment amount includes the MS-DRG amount, bill total per diem, beneficiary primary payer claim payment amount, beneficiary Part A coinsurance amount, beneficiary deductible amount, beneficiary blood deducible amount and DRG outlier amount.

> For these DRGs, average charges and average Medicare payments are calculated at the individual hospital level. Users will be able to make comparisons between the amount charged by individual hospitals within local markets, and nationwide, for services that might be furnished in connection with a particular inpatient stay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reading and manipulating the data
---------------------------------

Load the required libraries.

```r
require(RCurl, quietly = TRUE)
require(xtable, quietly = TRUE)
require(ggplot2, quietly = TRUE)
require(scales, quietly = TRUE)
require(RColorBrewer, quietly = TRUE)
```


RCurl with https is being tempermental. Copy the dataset to the local folder and `read.table` from there. Read the entire dataset. 

```r
# url <-
# getURL('https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/386956/Medicare_Provider_Charge_Inpatient_DRG100_FY2011.csv')
# df <- read.csv(textConnection(url), header=TRUE, sep=',')
df <- read.csv("Medicare_Provider_Charge_Inpatient_DRG100_FY2011.csv", header = TRUE, 
    sep = ",")
```


Create some new fields. 
* `DRGnum` is a numeric vector of the MS-DRG number without the description
* `DRGlab` is a character vector of the MS-DRG description without the number
* `OHSU` is a logical vector indicating if the row is from an OHSU provider

```r
df$DRGnum <- as.numeric(substr(df$DRG.Definition, 1, 3))
df$DRGlab <- substr(df$DRG.Definition, 7, max(nchar(as.character(df$DRG.Definition))))
df$OHSU <- grepl("^OHSU", df$Provider.Name)
```

Get vector of MS-DRGs that OHSU has data for.

```r
drgOHSU <- df$DRGnum[df$OHSU]
```


*TO-DO*

1. Create lookup table for MDC and DRG
2. Create MDC vector of MDC codes that OHSU has data for
3. Create working data subset that includes all providers from the MDCs in step 2.
4. Fix violin plots
  * Annotate with percentile
  * Flip coordinates?
  * Add `DRGlab` to axis tick labels?


Show the number of rows, the field names, and the first few rows.

According to [findacode.com](http://www.findacode.com/code-set.php?set=DRG&mdc=04), DRGs 207 and 208 (respiratory system with ventilator support) are grouped as medical DRGs under MDC 04 (diseases & disorders of the respiratory system). This doesn't seem right. I'm going to exclude these DRGs until further clarification.
DRGs 998 (principal diagnosis invalid as discharge diagnosis) and 999 (ungroupable) are also excluded.

Create function for violin plotting.

```r
DistnPlot <- function(d, title) {
    drg <- d$DRGnum[d$OHSU]
    d.subset <- subset(d, DRGnum %in% drg, select = c(DRGnum, Average.Covered.Charges, 
        OHSU))
    ggplot(d.subset, aes(x = as.character(DRGnum), y = Average.Covered.Charges)) + 
        # geom_boxplot(alpha=1/2, outlier.size=0) +
    geom_violin(alpha = 1/2, fill = "grey") + geom_point(data = d.subset[d.subset$OHSU, 
        ]) + scale_y_log10(breaks = c(10000, 20000, 40000, 80000, 160000, 320000), 
        labels = c("$10", "$20", "$40", "$80", "$160", "$320")) + labs(title = paste(title, 
        "Nationwide", sep = "\n"), x = "DRG", y = "Average Covered Charges ($1,000s)") +

        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "grey"), panel.grid.minor.y = NULL)
